i think driver should handle batching
so internal still just does normal box/text calls
and driver decides what to do... batch or immediate

if driver decides to batch (which im not doing yet)
then i will need a way to tell the driver when to draw
or...


	driver is really "driver" and
	it will do the LOOP...

		this might be interesting...
		because it makes more reusable?

		so then simpleui is legit a library that gets used
		by say a pixi app or a canvas app or an app written to be both and use simpleui
		and the app decides how to deal with "frame rate" (0.1 fps to 100+ fps)


that tangent is crazy
