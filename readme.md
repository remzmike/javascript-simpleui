simpleui - v00 - 12/8/2016 10:19:01 AM - preview release
simpleui - v01 - 9/16/2018 1:03 PM - added webgl support

## ABOUT

This is an "immediate-mode ui", which basically means ui components are functions.

This is useful because it changes the way gui applications are written and extended.

It is a work in progress, written in a straight-line style for easy experimentation.

## History.

I wrote this twice in C#, then ported to lua, then ported to this javascript.

Where has this library been used?

    * XNA (C#)
    * Mono GTK [cairo] (C#)
    * leaguebot (lua)
    * love2d (lua)
    * html webgl [pixi] (javascript)
    * html canvas (javascript)

## TODO
js dependencies (prolly require or something)

modularization of simpleui_ex_*, and more

refactor / semantic compression

nested stack auto id's

dom renderer (no canvas)
