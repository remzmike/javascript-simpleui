## ABOUT
this is an "immediate-mode ui", which basically means ui components are functions

this is useful because it changes the way gui applications are written and extended

it is a work in progress, written in a straight-line style for easy experimentation

i wrote this in c# first, then ported it to lua, then ported to this javascript

## TODO
js dependencies (prolly require or something)

modularization of simpleui_ex_*, and more

refactor / semantic compression

nested stack auto id's
